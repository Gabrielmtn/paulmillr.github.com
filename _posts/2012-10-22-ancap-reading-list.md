Here’s a list of books and articles about libertarianism / anarcho-capitalism which I recommend. It will be updating constantly.

#### Basics

You can read the basics of the philosophy in [anarcho-capitalist FAQ](http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/faq.html).

#### Books

1. [**Walter Block — Defending the undefendable**](http://mises.org/document/3490/Defending-the-Undefendable) — a tale on negative social / economic issues with governments prohibitions. Block defends pimps, drug dealers, blackmailers, corrupt policemen, and loan sharks as "economic heroes".
2. **David Bergland — Libertarianism in one lesson** — the basics about libertarian philosophy.
3. [**Murray Rothbard — What Has Government Done to Our Money?**](http://mises.org/document/617/What-Has-Government-Done-to-Our-Money) — the not-so-brief history of economics in XIX-XX centuries. How central banks fucked up all the shit, how the gold standard was fucked up.
4. [**Murray Rothbard — The Ethics of Liberty**](http://mises.org/document/1179/The-Ethics-of-Liberty). Describes ethics of libertarian philosophy, natural rights (freedoms). Contains a bit about rights of mother on her child and responses to consequentialist critics of non-aggression principle. Pretty similar to the previous book, although less interesting.
