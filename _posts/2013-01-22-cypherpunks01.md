The idea is to standardise patterns for anonymous usernames / passwords, make them well-known and use them collectively. [It is already in use](https://google.com/?q=cypherpunks01) by many people since early 2000s.

For anonymous login on any site:

1. Use login & password “`cypherpunks01`” (create if it does not exist).
2. Use login “`cypherpunks01`” with password “`Cypherpunks01`”, “`cypherpunks01cypherpunks01`”, “`Cyp-her-pun-ks0-1`” or “`C\_/Ph3rp@nks01`”.
3. Use login “`cypherpunks02`” (03, 04...), follow patterns from previous steps for password.

### Description & demand

Consider pretty typical situation on the internets:

1. You need to have an account on some website.
2. The site does not require your real identity and you will receive no advantages by registering under your well-known nickname.

You can use some random login, but there is a simple, nice and elegant solution which is used by [cypherpunks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) (homies that advocate for widespread use of cryptography and anononymity): “just use login and password **cypherpunks01**”. If the site already has account “cypherpunks01” and its password wasn’t changed, you will be able to login to it and use it freely. Or you can create it and someone else will use it in the future.

Although, some sites:

1. don’t allow same usernames & passwords
2. want passwords with uppercase letters and special symbols
3. already have account “cypherpunks01” and someone bad used non-standard password

This simple improvement of original cypherpunks idea shall fix these quirks.
