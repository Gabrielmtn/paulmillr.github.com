title: Moving from Tumblr to GitHub
---

Several days ago I decided to convert all my blog content to static HTML files and move everything to [GitHub](http://github.com/). The new blog is built with [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and located at the address [paulmillr.com](http://paulmillr.com). **Pros** of using GitHub over blog systems like blogger / tumblr:

- Code highlighting.
- Easy backups (git is distributed).
- No dependence on blog platform. Static HTML files could be stored on any hosting (even free ones).
- Great flexibility e.g. using HTML / Markdown / ReST to create new posts. I don't like that freaking WYSIWYG editors.

To setup new GitHub blog you'll need some basic HTML / CSS / Git knowledge.
[Watch ("follow") my blog on GitHub](https://github.com/paulmillr/paulmillr.github.com) (you'll need registered account there).
