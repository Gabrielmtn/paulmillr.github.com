My current thoughts on anarcho-capitalism and libertarianism.

Every section has description of how the life area will work, advantages of such way and responses to frequently appearing counter-arguments to anarcho-capitalists model.

* **Definition**
* **On efficiency of competition**
* **Private law (police and courts)**
* **Private roads, land and ocean**
* **Private money**
* **Life in general**
* **Conclusion**

## Definition
Libertarianism is a political philosophy, that has “non-aggression principle” in its basis. It is a pragmatic philosophy that doesn’t require a change in human nature, it concludes that there will always be bad people and that in general people behave better when they have freedom as compared to when they don’t.

You can find more information about that in [anarcho-capitalist faq](http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/faq.html).

## On efficiency of competition
You can often heard that “people are not prepared for freedom”. But you can only feel freedom when you have it. Someone may say that soviet people were not ready for capitalism and slaves were not ready for wage labour, but such steps (abolitionism, dissolution of the Soviet Union) move the world.

If *any* property is privatised and receives holders, it starts to receive the best possible care. Because this is profitable to holder, with proper management. It is not important who actually controls property. The important thing is that noone interferes with it involuntary (for example, state or bandit that takes 50% of profits).

If this really happens, in free market good and efficient entrepreneurs purchase more and more property, because their profits are higher and terms are better, and bad / inefficient entrepreneurs purchase less. As a result, the overall quality of all property rises. Without politics, the market itself punishes inefficient companies and promotes good ones.

## Private law (police and courts)
>That the public is willing to pay private providers so much shows that the government has already lost a part of its monopoly in violence and that certain functions that the government has usurped are being reprivatized. — Hans-Hermann Hoppe

Usually libertarians are minarchists or anarcho-capitalists. Minarchists think we still need the state — minimal, just for protection. Anarcho-capitalists think that security production can be performed more effectively in the free market. This particular article part expresses anarcho-capitalists point.

### How it works
* Privatised police / private defence agencies (“roofs”) will provide security and agression insurance services. They compete with other security providers and it comply to privately emerged set of laws.
* Privatised courts do arbitration only in such rare cases when PDAs could not reach an agreement with each other, because involving third party is more expensive than addressing the problem in place. PDAs are forced by market to comply with their judgement, otherwise they’ll lose customers and market share as these which don’t adhere to standards.
* There will be no modern prisons, because they’re tremendously inefficient. Prisons today just maintain convicts with taxpayers money. In a free society, private companies will be forcing aggressors to pay fines for damage done to private property or individuals. Private companies won’t be interested in paying for convicts, so they’ll be forced to pay for themselves. This does not mean they’ll be contained in boxes, as there are much more efficient ways to earn money to pay penalties.
* Because of voluntary nature of private firms, different people will be able to choose different law codes. For example, islamists will be able to use Sharia Law defence agencies. Of course, it will be applying if only other person uses islamic defense agency too. Otherwise, a common market law code will be applied, just like today with international crimes.
* There will be no gun control laws. Private defence agencies are not interested in disarming their clients because in that case a possibility that client will be subjected to aggression rises. And the firm is forced to pay insurance for these cases.

### Advantages
* Quality of security providers and courts will rise. They won’t have territorial monopolies as before and will be forced to comply at least with industrial standard. When some corporation won’t be able to protect its clients, it will lose them and money.
* There will be less corruption in courts and defence agencies, because private companies are less interested in it.
* Law-abiding citizens won’t be forced to pay for prisoners. Today USA spends 30K$/year on each convict. Norway people spend 100K$/year.

### Real-life examples
1. VIP persons and especially state servants (top-level politics) today usually hire private security firms for personal security.
2. Many states are already hiring private armies. For example, USA hired Blackwater during afghan war.

In 1990s, in Russia, state collapsed and was not been able to protect citizens and businesses. Private defence firms (roofs) had emerged.

At first, most firms were protection racketeers, requiring a tribute for ensuring that they don’t touch payer’s property.

But then, because of competition, only those agencies had survived, which cared more about their long-term relationships with clients.

You can read more about this in Vadim Volkov’s book: [Violent Entrepreneurs: The Use of Force in the Making of Russian Capitalism](http://www.amazon.com/Violent-Entrepreneurs-Making-Russian-Capitalism/dp/0801487781)

### Objections
> State had always provided security

Nah. Sovereign nation warfare-welfare-states emerged after Peace of Westphallia (1648).

> PDAs will defend only those people who will pay them more

We can draw an analogy with other industries. Why does Samsung care about all customers and not just about these which pay it more? Because they’ll lose profits from others that quit using Samsung products because of that.

On the other hand, today, when law is monopolised, those which can afford it, have more chances to win cases, as state does not have pressure of reputation and competition.

> PDAs will be at constant war with each other

Only initially and only if transition will be fast instead of gradual. More precisely, only for the first several years, if we’ll look at how things worked out for Russia in 1990s. In the end only efficient PDAs will survive and security production will become much better than now. War always has very big costs and it’s unfavorable to fight for long-established firms.

> Someone will create a PDA that will be radically fanatically its clients regardless of their rightness

Other PDAs wouldn’t tolerate loss of profits as their clients will be disadvantaged. Then other firms will likely be cooperating in order to defeat bad PDA.

> Poor people, which can’t afford security, will be constant victims of aggression

1. Some companies will have lower prices than other that poor people will be more likely able to afford.
2. Some companies will want to provide their services for free to some people in order to increase their reputation.
3. As there will be no gun control laws, everyone will be able to buy some pocket gun for self-protection.

## Private roads, land and ocean
All roads, land and ocean in free society will have its owners.

### Advantages
### Real-life example

## Private money
In libertarian society there will be no fiat state-emissioned money. Instead of this, market will adopt some voluntary industry standard.

## Life in general
Life in general will be much more free.

## Conclusion

There are hundreds of facts that freedom is more efficient that regulations. Unfortunately, mainstream political movements still prefer Big Government.

We (libertarians) should educate people about the benefits, this is the only legit way libertarian society can be reached in our timelines.

There are plenty of books written on libertarianism and if you are interested in any, I recommend to read [my post on the recommended literature](http://paulmillr.com/posts/libertarian-reading-list/).
